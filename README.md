## Overview

FraudShield AI is a machine learning application built to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The application uses a trained Random Forest classifier and provides an interactive Streamlit interface for predicting whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

This project was developed as part of the Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course.

## Machine Learning Model

Final Model: Random Forest Classifier

The model was trained on the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset and optimized for highly imbalanced data.

### Performance

| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Precision | 98.1% |
| Recall | 70.3% |
| F1 Score | 81.9% |
| ROC-AUC | 92.99% |
| PR-AUC | 81.08% |

These results indicate that the model detects fraudulent transactions with high precision while maintaining strong recall.

## Dataset

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset

- Total Transactions: 284,807
- Fraudulent Transactions: 492
- Legitimate Transactions: 284,315

The dataset is highly imbalanced, making Precision-Recall AUC an important evaluation metric.
